### Overview

The first is an OVERVIEW Entry - this is the Introduction, it explains the purpose of the blog, that it is documenting the freedom project (and what that is), and what you are writing about.
There is _only one_ overview entry.

*Context*
The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about a course-long project where students will apply everything they have learned to create their own website, as well as reflecting on their creations. 10th graders are making a website about their topic using HTML, CSS and (tbd) elements to make the site using Github. in my case, i am making a website related to operating sytems.

The purpose of this blog is to show what we know about coding related stuff as well as writing about a topic related to STEM that we chose to write about because we had an interest in it.

*Content*
For my project, I am making a website about operating systems using Github, HTML, and CSS.

This blog will document the process of independently studying operating systems and (tbd) and making the website.
